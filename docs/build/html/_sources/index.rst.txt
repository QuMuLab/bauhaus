Welcome to ``bauhaus``!
=========================================
``bauhaus`` is a Python library for building logical theories on the fly from object-oriented code. Theories can be passed to SAT solvers using the companion library ``python-nnf``.

Features
--------
* Create propositional variables from Python classes
* Create naive SAT encoding constraints from propositional variables
   - At most one
   - At least one
   - Exactly one
   - At most K
   - Implies all
* Compile constraints into a CNF theory
* With ``python-nnf``, submit a theory to a SAT solver
* Inspect an encodingâ€™s process from transforming an instance object to a constraint in the final theory


How is it used?
---------------

Create an Encoding object to store propositions and SAT constraints: ::

   from bauhaus import Encoding

   e = Encoding()

Create propositions by decorating classes with ``@proposition(encoding)`` and an Encoding object.
Each instance of a decorated class is stored as a propositional variable in the Encoding::

   @proposition(e)
   class Object:
      pass

Create constraints by decorating classes and methods using the decorator ``@constraint``.
To create a constraint for a method, the return object must be from a decorated class or a propositional variable created with ``python-nnf``::

   @constraint.at_most_one(e) # At most one of the Object instances are true
   @proposition(e)
   class Object:
      
      def __init__(self, x):
         from nnf import Var
         self.x = Var(x)
      
      def __repr__(self): return f'Object.{self.x}'
      
      @constraint.implies_all(e): # Each instance implies self.x
      def func(self):
         return self.x

You can also create a constraint involving an arbitrary number of arguments of any of the following types:

* class that has the ``@proposition`` decorator
* an object of that class
* a proposition variable created by the library
* an iterable of any of the listed
::
   
   # create object instances
   objects = [Object(i) for i in 'abc'] # Object_a,..., Object_c
   constraint.at_least_one(e, Object, [objects[3], objects[2]])

Compile the theory to a CNF (conjunctive normal form) or to an NNF by setting ``CNF=False``::
   
   theory = e.compile(CNF=True)
   # spaced for clarity,
   >> theory = And({And({Or({~Var(Object.c), c}),
                         Or({~Var(Object.a), a}),
                         Or({~Var(Object.b), b})}),
                    And({Or({~Var(Object.c), ~Var(Object.a)}),
                         Or({~Var(Object.c), ~Var(Object.b)}),
                         Or({~Var(Object.a), ~Var(Object.b)})}),
                    Or({Var(Object.c), Var(Object.b), Var(Object.a)})})
